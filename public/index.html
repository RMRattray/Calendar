      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h1>Calendar designer and converter</h1>
      <p>The page below lets you design your own calendar - with your own 
        choice of start date, leap years, months, and more!  Dates can be 
        converted from the familiar calendar to yours.  Good for timelines
        in over-planned fiction.  At the bottom, you can download a file 
        of your calendar that you can upload again to "save" your calendar.

      This HTML file is a template.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

      <p>For those reading this as a porfolio piece:  this was made in ReactJS; its ability to create 
          reusable custom components reduced the amount of code necessary to produce the supercomponents
          of similar look and feel.  This is also my first online piece to work with file upload and download,
          in this case JSONs.
