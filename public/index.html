      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <title>Calendar converter in ReactJS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div>
      <h1>Calendar designer and converter</h1>
      <p>The below form lets you design your own calendar, with your own start date,
          years and months and weeks and leap days of the length and frequency of your choice.
      </p>
      <p>For those reading this as a porfolio piece:  this was made in ReactJS; its ability to create 
          reusable custom components reduced the amount of code necessary to produce all these div
          adjusting their visibility by checkboxes and divs the quantity of which is modified by a number input 
          and such.  The calendar and date list are, of course, kept in a reducer.
      </p>
      <p>For those using this as a calendar:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start date, and dates to be converted, are given using the proleptic Gregorian calendar.</li>
        <li>Your start date will be the day that corresponds to the first day of the Year 1 and of the 
          first month cycle in your calendar, even if you opt to include a Year 0.  It will be presumed to be 
          the first day of the week (Monday, if you do not change the weekday names).
        </li>
        <li>The length of the year does not have to align with the cycle of months.  Changes to the month cycle 
          do not affect the length of the year unless the relevant box is checked.
        </li>
        <li>Similarly, leap month cycles and leap years need not be the same.  After all,
          the motion of the Moon and the revolution of Earth around the Sun are as independent of each other 
          as they are independent of the rotation of the Earth about its axis.
        </li>
        <li>The number of leap days in a leap month cycle or leap year need not be one (it may even be negative).
          However, there are not leap weeks.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="root"></div>
